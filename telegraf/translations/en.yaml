configuration:
  hostname:
    name: Set Hostname
    description: Set an alternative hostname for the telegraf instance.
  influxDB:
    name: Enable InfluxDB
    description: Enable and set connection config to InfluxDB
  influxDBv2:
    name: Enable InfluxDBv2
    description: Enable and set connection config to InfluxDBv2
  interval:
    name: Set Agent Interval
    description: Default data collection interval for all inputs
  round_interval:
    name: Rounds collection interval
    description:  Rounds collection interval to interval. For example, if interval is set to 10s, then the agent collects on :00, :10, :20, etc.
  skip_processor_after_aggregation:
    name: Set Agent skip_processors_after_aggregators var
    description: If true, processors do not run again after aggregators. Default is false.
  metric_batch_size:
    name: Sends metrics to the output in batches
    description: Sends metrics to the output in batches of at most metric_batch_size metrics.
  metric_buffer_limit:
    name: Set caches metric_buffer_limit metrics
    description: Caches metric_buffer_limit metrics for each output, and flushes this buffer on a successful write. This should be a multiple of metric_batch_size and could not be less than 2 times metric_batch_size.
  collection_jitter:
    name: Used to jitter the collection by a random amount
    description: Used to jitter the collection by a random amount. Each plugin sleeps for a random time within jitter before collecting. This can be used to avoid many plugins querying things like sysfs at the same time, which can have a measurable effect on the system.
  flush_interval:
    name: Sets default data flushing interval for all outputs
    description: Default data flushing interval for all outputs. Don’t set this below interval. Maximum flush_interval is flush_interval + flush_jitter
  flush_jitter:
    name: Jitter the flush interval by a random amount
    description: Jitter the flush interval by a random amount. This is primarily to avoid large write spikes for users running a large number of Telegraf instances. For example, a flush_jitter of 5s and flush_interval of 10s means flushes happen every 10-15s.
  precision:
    name: Collected metrics are rounded to the precision specified
    description: "Collected metrics are rounded to the precision specified as an interval (integer + unit, ex: 1ns, 1us, 1ms, and 1s . Precision isn’t used for service inputs, such as logparser and statsd."
